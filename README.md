# Pronounce It

## Introduction
Pronounce It is a game based on Hms Automatic Speech Recognition and Text to Speech features. It is aimed to use these technologies widely in practice and to facilitate their use by developers. We developed this game for users who want to measure and improve their pronunciation while speaking English. In this game users pronounce the sentences displayed on the screen and the accuracy of this pronunciation was measured. This accuracy value shows the user's success in the game. Pronounce It is playable in different categories, keeps leaderboard scores, supports two language and most importantly the whole app can be voice controlled to use ASR more frequently.
